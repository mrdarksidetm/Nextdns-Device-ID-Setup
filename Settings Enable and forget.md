## Ai Driven Threat Protection
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) AI constantly improves

## Google Safe Browsing
Block malware and phishing domains using Google Safe Browsing ‚Äî a technology that examines billions of URLs per day looking for unsafe websites. Unlike the version embedded in some browsers, this does not associate your public IP address to threats and does not allow bypassing the block.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable Safe Browsing

## Cryptojacking Protection
Prevent the unauthorized use of your devices to mine cryptocurrency.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable Cryptojacking Protection

## DNS Rebinding Protection
Prevent attackers from taking control of your local devices through the Internet by automatically blocking DNS responses containing private IP addresses. <br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable DNS Rebinding Protection

## IDN Homograph Attacks Protection
Block domains that impersonate other domains by abusing the large character set made available with the arrival of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) ‚Äî e.g. replacing the Latin letter "e" with the Cyrillic letter "–µ".<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable Homograph Attacks Protection

## Typosquatting Protection
Block domains registered by malicious actors that target users who incorrectly type a website address into their browser ‚Äî e.g. gooogle.com instead of google.com.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable Typosquatting Protection

## Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) Protection
Block domains generated by Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) seen in various families of malware that can be used as rendezvous points with their command and control servers.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Enable DGA Protection

## Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)
Block domains registered less than 30 days ago. Those domains are known to be favored by threat actors to launch malicious campaigns.<br>
![Disabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/disabled.svg) Block Newly Registered Domains (NRDs)

## Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames
beta
Dynamic DNS (or DDNS) services let malicious actors quickly set up hostnames for free and without any validation or identity verification. While legit DDNS hostnames are rarely accessed in every-day use, their malicious counterparts are heavily used in phishing campaigns ‚Äî e.g. paypal‚Äëlogin.duckdns.org.
If you are using DDNS, note that this setting will not block the DDNS services' own website or their update API.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Block Dynamic DNS Hostnames

## Block Parked Domains
Parked domains are single-page websites often laden with ads and devoid of any value. Parked domain monetization can sometimes get mixed up with suspicious practices and malicious content.<br>
![Disabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/disabled.svg) Block Parked Domains

## Block Top-Level Domains (TLDs)
![Disabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/disabled.svg) Block all domains and subdomains belonging to specific TLDs.

## Block Child Sexual Abuse Material
Block domains hosting child sexual abuse material with the help of Project Arachnid, operated by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection. No information is transmitted back to Project Arachnid when a domain is blocked.<br>
![Enabled](https://github.com/mrdarksidetm/Nextdns-Device-ID-Setup/blob/9d1a40ee6b6f71d49821ede6e3b071f47ae4b464/icons/enabled.svg) Block Child Sexual Abuse Material
